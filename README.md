Are You Joking utilizes an API, https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api, that generates random jokes. 

Are You Joking features a React front end.

It incorporates the CSS fade-in transition property.

It features a mobile-first design, CSS media queries to make the site responsive on all devices.

(And YES, I know most of these jokes are really bad. Which is why, as a dad, I love them!)
